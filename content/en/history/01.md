Four years later, in 1968, the new road that connected Collepietra and Bolzano directly was finally opened to the public. Clearly, it brought great facilitations to the transport service. It became possible to move students with the first bigger busses of the company.

Just after one year the busses were traveling daily between Collepietra and the city. The company got bigger and bigger, providing more and more services. Finally, in the year 1972 the depot had to be rebuilt.
