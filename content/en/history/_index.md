The history of the Mahlknecht company started in the year 1964, when the founder Josef Mahlknecht started using his two vans to move people along the old road that connected the villages of Collepietra and Cardano. It was a big luxury to have such a service. Until then, people were used to have a long walk to reach Bolzano city.
